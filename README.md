* Input the valid YouTube video URL from the user. The First step is to getting the video link from the user which user wants to summarize. The video should be Recorded, it should have a valid video id and it should be available on YouTube. These are some of the things that user should keep in mind before using this web application.
* Getting the transcripts from that video. After taking the video link from the user, the next part is to get the transcripts on video. Now it will check whether the given video has subtitles available or not. If the Given video has subtitles in it then we can simply use the python library called YouTube_Transcript_Api which is used to extract the transcripts from the given video. Now what if the given video doesn't have subtitles in it so in this case we will first convert the video into audio format like .mp3 or .mp4 format using python library called pytube and then download that audio file. After downloading the audio file, there is a need to convert it into .wav file using ffmpeg and then doing its audio Transcription using Speech Recognition Library and Hugging sound Library. It will basically convert that audio file into text file which contains the Transcription of the video.
